# Monte-Carlo-Localization on Lego NXT Mindstorms

This is a set of classes to enable the Lego NXT Robot to make use of the Monte-Carlo-Localization algorithm from the [Artificial Intelligence - A Modern Approach 3rd Edition](http://aima.cs.berkeley.edu/) [Java implementation](https://github.com/aimacode/aima-java/tree/AIMA3e) in connection with the [leJos NXJ framework](http://www.lejos.org/nxj.php).

If you just want to run the program with the robot model included in this repository pick the latest [release](/releases).

The implementation consists of 2 parts:

###1. [NXT daemon](/MCL_Mindstorms_NXT/src/de/thkoeln/gm/mcl_mindstorms/daemon/MclDaemon.java)

The NXT runs a daemon in the leJos runtime. This daemon awaits a bluetooth connection and process the commands which are sent from the PC.

###2. [PC controls](/MCL_Mindstorms/src/de/thkoeln/gm/mcl_mindstorms/gui/NXTApp.java)

The PC is controlling the NXT. It displays a GUI from which the user can control the Monte-Carlo-Localization algorithm and the robot.
All parameters regarding both algorithm and robot can be managed from this GUI.

###Additional data

In addition a few [SVG maps](/maps) for example environments included.
A model created with the Lego Digital Designer and instructions to rebuild that model can be found in [LEGO instructions](/LEGO_instructions).
A documentation of the implementation and a user manual can be found in the [documentation](/documentation) directory. Both documents are written in german.
